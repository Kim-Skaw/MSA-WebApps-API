## Playlist Maker

### What this app aims to offer

This mobile application is for frequent music listeners who like to create playlists for themselves. It is focused more on people who enjoy the music from early 2010 - 2017 and this Playlist Maker app offers songs that will fit the nostalgic vibe. An example person that fits the focus of the app will be 'Sang'.

Sang is a 22-year-old uni student and one of his favorite things to do while using public transport or studying is to listen to music. However, he likes listening to old school music and his favorite songs are from early 2010. When he tries to search songs that he likes on the music apps, most of the searches are filtered by the current or the lastest released songs and it makes it difficult for him to find songs particular songs. 

Using this application, the Sang will be able to make an old school playlist that is easy to create and easy to remove. In this application, the Sang is provided with a wide range of popular music from 2010-2017 and he would be able to search songs/artists by searching either the song's name or artist's name or even the year. He would also be able to sort the songs alphabetically if he wishes to. This way, Sang will be easily able to find the particular song that he wishes to listen to without the need of scrolling down rapidly.


### Extensibility of the app

This app could be extended to a wider range of audiences who are specific with their music taste. The app could utilize different databases that focus on different genres of music, and within the app, the users could search on different datasets e.g. large datasets of Rock songs from the early 2000s. Furthermore, the app could be extended to not only make playlists for music but also watchlists for movies from different eras or categories. This could reach a much wider audience who are interested in both music and movies. Moreover, all of the playlists from the app could be connected to other music/movie apps through API to transfer the playlists that are made within this app. This will be the desired future modification for the app.
